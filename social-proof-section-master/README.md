## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

[Collapsing margins](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins).
For an element with margin and its parent with margin, shorter margin may collapse if there is nothing between, such as parent's padding or border. When one margin is collapsed, only the greater is considered for both elements.
